## Raspberry Pi & camera - pose estimation
### Calibration & pose estimation using AruCo markers
Part of the final thesis Virtual Neonatal Cranial Ultrasonography Simulation. 

During the project my primary responsibility was the hardware and software of the simulation tracking
system; e.g. a Raspberry Pi setup and the software and coding needed to run the AruCo tracking
and pose estimation. In this repository you'll find the python code using OpenCV (an open source computer vision and machine 
learning software library, which contains real-time vision applications.
